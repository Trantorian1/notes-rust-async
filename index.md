# Welcome to Async Rust!

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è  This is a personal note guide designed for the study of asynchronous Rust, use at you own risk!

The combination of Rust's low-level architecture as well as memory safety and ownership model make it an excellent candidate for *easily* writing <u>safe(r)</u> multihreaded code:

* Rust being low-level allows for excellent runtime multithreading (no garbage collector)!
* Rust's ownership model makes it very difficult to introduce data races into a multithreaded environment.
* Rust's [package ecosystem](https://crates.io/categories/asynchronous) has excellent support for asynchronous paradigms.

## A few definitions

> üìö **asynchronous code** describes code that can execute in a *non-blocking* way and *out-of-order*. This is especially important to keep in mind in the context of Rust ownership since `async` functions can theoretically live for as long as the program itself, so any data used must be *owned* by that function.

> üìö a **lock** is a low-level asynchronous primitive used to synchronize data across threads. There are several types of locks in Rust, such a `Mutex` and `RwLock`.

> üìö an **executor** describes is an environment used to run `async` code. Simply put it is a set of code, often library-generated, which is responsible for running your `async` functions and handling their distribution across multiple hardware threads.

> üìö **hardware threads** are an os-level primitive for handling concurrency. When you create a new hardware thread, you are creating a 1:1 copy of the stack which then lives independently and simultaneously to the rest of your program. *Hardware threads are computationally expensive*, which is why we generally refer to techniques such as [thread monitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(synchronization)) to distribute *many* `async` operations across *few* hardware threads.

## Some things to keep in mind

Rust is *not* magic. What I mean by that is that -like any other programming language- Rust will not save you from yourself. It is *still* possible to introduce data races and it *still* possible to engineer new and creative **runtime** exceptions. Where Rust's truly shines is in it's ability to let let you focus on algorithms instead of the implementation of low-level primitives: existing abstractions allow you to focus on the problem at hand, instead having to deal with already-solved problems. Think of Rust in this context as a mix between high-level abstractions while maintaining low-level performance.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note that this still comes at the cost of a higher learning curve, especially when considering lifetimes (which can be quite a hindrance initially).
